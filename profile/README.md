# RTST APP - Art + Tech

The RTST app is a dedicated space for artists to share content to THEIR audiences and only THEIR audiences.  You've done the work of building a following.  Why not monetize that following, as you spend your time building up more of a following?  With the RTST app, artists are afforded a dedicated web page or mobile app(s) where they can feature their content as they choose to their fan base that has specifically sought them out.  The RTST app does not charge customers for using it's platform.  We allow the customers to purchase an artist's content based on the artists wishes.  Artists can sell an album, a short video, a collection of photos, a feature length movie, etc.  The artist will feature their content on social media as well as get recommendations from the RTST app on audio and video features to share on social media.  The RTST app is not a replacement for social media and streaming services, but rather a monetized area for artists to create value from their hard work.
